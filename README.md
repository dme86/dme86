### Hi there! üëã

I'm Dan, a DevOps engineer who is passionate about Linux & open source software.

## Configuration Repositories üè¢

I have split my configuration files into separate repositories, allowing users to pick and choose what they want from my setup without having to download my complete `.config` files. For my daily work, I have configured [neovim](https://github.com/dme86/neovim) as an IDE and use [tmux](https://github.com/dme86/tmux) for tabs and splits for every terminal. Recently, I switched to [fish](https://github.com/dme86/fish) for my shell.

As a minimal window manager, I use [dwm](https://github.com/dme86/dwm), and my [wallpaper collection](https://github.com/dme86/.wallpapers) is also backed up on GitHub.

I started using GitHub as a platform for [my blog](https://dme86.github.io/). 

## Linux üêß

[Gentoo](https://www.gentoo.org/) and [Arch](https://archlinux.org/) are by far my favorite operating systems.

Gentoo can be installed on a variety of hardware, including [ARM](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:ARM), [RISC-V](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:RISC-V), and [PowerPC](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:PowerPC). [Portage](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Portage), Gentoo's package manager, is the greatest package manager out there in my opinion. Being able to set [USE flags](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/USE_flag) and build packages exactly how I need them is just awesome! 
The most important aspect of Gentoo is that it allows you to choose everything, from kernels and init-systems to hardware and tailored software packages.

While Gentoo can be a great experience in a desktop environment, I personally think Arch is the better choice for installing on your notebook or PC. As a power user, I need access to big software repositories like Arch's [AUR](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_User_Repository). 
I have often found software in the AUR that was not available on Gentoo's [GURU](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:GURU), for example. Setting up Arch via [archinstall](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/archinstall) on a new machine or in a virtual environment is also a blissful experience.
